# Lesson 1: Containers

## Overview

This is a repo containing very basic code to build a docker image and run it on one's local machine. This should get you started with tweaking a container's code and observing its behaviour.

This container simply renders an html page with a textbox prompting that you provide a 'secret' (or anything really). When you click on the 'Echo' button, the secret is echoed back to you. And voil√†!

## Pre-requisites

Ensure that you have [downloaded and installed docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Please select the installation guide for your operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux) and follow the instructions.

## Usage

Clone this repo, and navigate within the [Lesson-1-Containers directory]().
